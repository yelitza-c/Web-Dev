      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a first generation college student. I began my college career at UIC, and
        believed I wanted to pursue a degree in software engineering. As I began
        taking courses related to the degree, I soon realized that I greatly disliked
        them. I then switched into the opposite side of the spectrum and on my second
        year decided I would change my major to Criminology and Law. In the
        end I disliked it as well.
